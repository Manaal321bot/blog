- **Navigation Updates** - Added "Users" link to main navigation
- **Responsive Design** - All new pages are mobile-responsive

## File Structure

### Controllers
- `UserController.java` - Handles user search and profile viewing (existing, enhanced)
- `DashboardController.java` - Enhanced to show all posts and user activities

### Models
- `UserActivity.java` - Model for tracking user activities (existing)
- `Account.java` - User account model (existing)
- `Post.java` - Blog post model with enhanced features (existing)
- `Comment.java` - Comment model (existing)

### Services
- `UserActivityService.java` - Service for activity tracking and statistics (existing, enhanced)
- `AccountService.java` - User management service with search capabilities (existing)
- `PostService.java` - Post management service (existing, enhanced)

### Templates
- `user_search.html` - User search page template
- `user_profile.html` - Individual user profile template  
- `dashboard.html` - Enhanced dashboard with activities and all posts (existing, enhanced)
- `home.html` - Updated navigation (existing, enhanced)

### Database Migrations
- `V4__add_user_activity_table.sql` - Creates user activity tracking table

## Technical Features

### Search Functionality
- **Text-based Search** - Search users by first name, last name, or email
- **Pagination** - Results are paginated for better performance
- **Case-insensitive** - Search is not case-sensitive
- **Activity Logging** - All searches are logged for analytics

### Activity Tracking
- **Session Tracking** - Automatic time tracking for user sessions
- **Event Logging** - Comprehensive logging of user interactions
- **Statistics Generation** - Real-time calculation of user statistics
- **Performance Optimized** - Database indexes for fast queries

### Data Storage
- **PostgreSQL/H2 Compatible** - Works with both development and production databases
- **JPA/Hibernate** - Uses Spring Data JPA for database operations
- **Transaction Management** - Proper transaction handling for data consistency
- **Foreign Key Constraints** - Maintains data integrity

## Usage Instructions

### Accessing User Search
1. Navigate to "Users" in the main navigation
2. Use the search bar to find users by name or email
3. Click "View Profile" to see detailed user information

### Viewing User Profiles
1. From user search results, click "View Profile" on any user card
2. View user's posts, statistics, and recent activities
3. Navigate through user's posts using pagination

### Dashboard Features
1. Access dashboard from main navigation when logged in
2. View posts from all users (not just your own)
3. See your personal statistics in the header
4. Check recent activities in the sidebar

### Activity Tracking
- Activities are automatically logged when you:
  - Login/logout
  - Create, view, or interact with posts
  - Search for users or posts
  - View other users' profiles
- Time spent is automatically tracked per session

## Performance Considerations

### Database Optimization
- Indexes on frequently queried columns
- Pagination to limit result sets
- Efficient JPA queries with proper joins

### Memory Management
- Lazy loading for large collections
- Paginated results to prevent memory issues
- Efficient session management for time tracking

### Security
- Authentication required for most features
- Authorization checks for sensitive operations
- SQL injection prevention through JPA

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements
1. **Advanced Search Filters** - Filter by user role, join date, activity level
2. **Social Features** - Follow/unfollow users, friend requests
3. **Real-time Notifications** - Live updates for new activities
4. **Analytics Dashboard** - Advanced statistics and charts
5. **Export Features** - Export user data and activities
6. **API Endpoints** - REST API for mobile app integration

### Scalability Considerations
1. **Caching** - Redis cache for frequently accessed data
2. **Search Engine** - ElasticSearch for advanced search capabilities
3. **Message Queues** - Async processing for activity logging
4. **Microservices** - Split into user service and activity service

## Testing

### Build Status
- ✅ Compilation successful
- ✅ No conflicts with existing code
- ✅ Templates properly integrated
- ✅ Database migrations ready

### Manual Testing Required
1. Test user search functionality
2. Verify user profile viewing
3. Check activity logging accuracy
4. Validate dashboard enhancements
5. Test pagination on all pages

## Conclusion

The enhanced blog application now provides comprehensive user discovery and activity tracking features while maintaining the existing functionality. Users can search for and view other users' profiles, posts, and activities, while the system automatically tracks all interactions for analytics and user engagement insights.

The implementation follows Spring Boot best practices and maintains backward compatibility with the existing codebase.
